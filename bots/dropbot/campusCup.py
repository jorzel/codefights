"""
Dropbox holds a competition between schools called CampusCup. If you verify an email address from a college, university, or higher education institution, you earn 20 points toward your school's overall ranking. When a school receives at least 100 points, all of its registered members receive an additional 3 Gb of bonus space each. When the school receives at least 200 points, its registered members receive an additional 8 Gb. If the school receives at least 300 points, its members receive an additional 15 Gb. And finally, when a school receives at least 500 points, members receive an additional 25 Gb each.

You are given n registered emails, all of them unique. Each email has the following format: "<name>@<domain>", where <name> and <domain> are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters and a '.'. Identical domains correspond to the same school and vice versa.

Your task is to make a scoreboard, i.e. to sort the schools according to the amount of bonus space they each received (per student not in total). School A must be higher in the standings than school B if A received more space than B, or if they received equal number of gigabytes but the domain string of school A is lexicographically smaller than the one of school B.

Example

For emails = ["john.doe@mit.edu", "admin@rain.ifmo.ru", "noname@mit.edu"], the output should be
campusCup(emails) = ["mit.edu", "rain.ifmo.ru"].

"mit.edu" scored 40 points, and "rain.ifmo.ru" just 20. Both universities got no additional space, so "mit.edu" must be higher in the standings because it is lexicographically smaller than "rain.ifmo.ru".

For

emails = ["b@harvard.edu", "c@harvard.edu", "d@harvard.edu", 
          "e@harvard.edu", "f@harvard.edu",
          "a@student.spbu.ru", "b@student.spbu.ru", "c@student.spbu.ru", 
          "d@student.spbu.ru", "e@student.spbu.ru", "f@student.spbu.ru", 
          "g@student.spbu.ru"]
the output should be
campusCup(emails) = ["harvard.edu", "student.spbu.ru"].

"harvard.edu" - 100 points, 3 Gb of additional space.
"student.spbu.ru" - 140 points, also 3 Gb of additional space.

"harvard.edu" must be higher in the standings because it is lexicographically smaller than "student.spbu.ru".

For

emails = ["a@rain.ifmo.ru", "b@rain.ifmo.ru", "c@rain.ifmo.ru", 
          "d@rain.ifmo.ru", "e@rain.ifmo.ru", "noname@mit.edu"]
the output should be
campusCup(emails) = ["rain.ifmo.ru", "mit.edu"].

"mit.edu" - 20 points, no additional space.
"rain.ifmo.ru" - 100 points, 3 Gb of additional space.

Therefore, "rain.ifmo.ru" must be higher in the standings.
